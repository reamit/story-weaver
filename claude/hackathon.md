[200~# CLAUDE.md

## 🎯 Purpose of the Hackathon

The primary goal of this hackathon is to help engineers build intuition around what’s being called **Software 3.0**—a new era of development where AI plays a central role in how we write, design, and deliver software.

## 🧠 Expectations for Developers

- **Everyone participates** – this is not optional.
- **Use Claude** to write **90% of your code, PRDs, and designs**. This is not just allowed—it’s the expectation.
- You’ll be shown **how to work with Claude efficiently** during the kickoff.

## 🧰 Tech Constraints (or lack thereof)

- You may use **any language** (Java, Python, NodeJS, etc.)
- You may use **any database**.
- You may deploy using **any platform**, but you must have a **live, shareable version** by EOD.

### Suggested Deploy Platforms:
- **Render** (recommended for backend-heavy/full-stack apps)
- **Vercel** (recommended for front-end or static apps)

## 🧩 Project Guidelines

- **Avoid trivial apps** – e.g. a basic todo app won’t cut it.
- Choose a **real problem** that showcases AI’s ability to reason, generate, or automate.
- Backend engineers must include a **UI component** (touch React, layout, structure).
- Frontend engineers should include **backend or offline functionality** (learn server-side workflows, APIs, jobs, DBs).
- Projects will be judged on:
  - **Quality of Work** (functionality, polish)
  - **Use of AI** (must be central, not superficial)
  - **Creativity** (novel problem, clever implementation)
  - **Depth** (impact, scalability, relevance)

## 🧪 Hackathon Day Structure

- The day starts at **8:00 AM EDT on Friday, June 27**.
- First 30 minutes: **live setup session** with guidance on Claude usage and idea selection.
- Bring 2-3 **backup ideas** in case your primary one isn’t chosen or seems unviable.
- Build, iterate, and deploy by EOD.
- Support floaters will be available throughout the day to help with Claude, APIs, deployment, etc.

## 🚀 Post-Hackathon Momentum

- This is the kickoff to **"Make It Rain July"** – $10K+ in awards will go to people who continue using AI meaningfully in daily work.
- For engineers, this includes:
  - Claude-assisted PRs
  - Design and implementation plans
  - Smart use of internal tools and bots

## 🤝 Support

- If you’re blocked on tooling, Claude, or setup, reach out in the designated Slack channel.
- Ask your **Tech Lead** for setup help if you haven’t received instructions.

Let’s build.
